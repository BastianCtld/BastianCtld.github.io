		This car's unique suspension setup and engine sound make it very engaging to drive,
		which is what I am attempting to replicate.<br>

		3D modeling

		<br>
		I made my own 3D model of the car from scratch because I wanted to learn 3D modeling,
		I wanted the result to be custom-made for Assetto Corsa, and there was no good 3D model of the
		car online to base my work on.<br>
		I used photoscanning to create a base for me to model over using Blender.<br>
		While I was more interested in modeling the physics, this car is truly beautiful, so it was important for me to accurately replicate its looks and I am satisfied with the result. <br>

		Here is a preview of the interior geometry. The same process of photoscanning is used.<br>

		Physics modeling
		</h2>

		<br>
		Modeling the physics of the car accurately is tricky because 
		Fiat hasn't shared a lot of technical information on this car.<br>
		While I have to guess and estimate for some of the data, I try to base 
		my modeling on measurements as much as possible.<br>
		<br>
		The scan on the right was taken on an incline at a farm's axle weighing scale to calculate the height of the car's center of gravity.<br>
		I scanned my suspension as seen on the right to accurately model the suspension geometry.<br>
		This car has a unique setup of double-wishbone suspension in front, and a special multilink setup at the rear, giving it noticeable passive rear-wheel steering, which I hope to replicate in-game.<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		I taped my phone to the car and drove around, using its sensors to gather data on the car's pitch/roll under longitudinal and lateral acceleration.<br>
		Knowing the car's center of gravity height and suspension geometry, I hope to be able to approximate the front and rear wheel rate and anti-roll bar stiffness thanks to this data.<br>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		
		I have showed you all of this in the hope you can feel my passion for cars, driving dynamics, vehicle physics and racing games.<br>
		I love Gran Turismo and I would be thrilled to interview for this internship.<br>
