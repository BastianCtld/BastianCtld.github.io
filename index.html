		<h1>Some of my work recreating my Alfa Romeo 156</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		I am in the process of modeling my car for the simulation game Assetto Corsa.<br>
		This Alfa Romeo 156 is very fun to drive thanks to its great engine and unique suspension setup,
		and I am attempting to faithfully convey this in my recreation.<br>
		<br>
		The following is an overview of the different parts of the work I have done to achieve this goal.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2>
		3D modeling
		</h2>

		<br>
		I made my own 3D model of the car from scratch because I wanted to learn 3D modeling,
		I wanted the result to be custom-made for Assetto Corsa, and there was no good 3D model of the
		car online to base my work on.<br>
		I used photoscanning to create a base for me to model over using Blender.<br>
		While I was more interested in modeling the physics, I find this car truly beautiful, so it was important for me to accurately replicate its looks and I am satisfied with the result. <br>

		Here is the interior geometry. The same process of photoscanning was used.<br>
		
		<br>

		<h2>
		Physics modeling
		</h2>

		<img src="suspension.jpg" height="400" />
		<br>
		Modeling the physics of the car accurately is tricky because 
		Fiat hasn't shared a lot of technical information on this car.<br>
		While I have to guess and estimate for some of the data, I try to base 
		my modeling on measurements as much as possible.<br>
		<br>
		The scan in the first image was taken on an incline at a farm's axle weighing scale to try to calculate the height of the car's center of gravity.<br>
		I scanned my suspension as seen on the second image to accurately model the suspension geometry.<br>
		This car has Alfa's special multilink setup at the rear, giving it noticeable passive rear-wheel steering, which I hope to replicate in-game.<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		I taped my phone to the car and drove around, using its sensors to gather data on the car's pitch/roll under longitudinal and lateral acceleration.<br>
		Knowing the car's center of gravity height and suspension geometry, I hope to be able to approximate the front and rear wheel rate and anti-roll bar stiffness thanks to this data.<br>

		<h2>
		Engine sound recreation
		</h2>
		
		<br>
		I felt having a good, authentic engine sound was important because bad engine sounds stick out and make mods feel unpolished.<br>
		<br>
		In Assetto Corsa, I found engine sound quality comes down almost entirely to the quality of the sound capture.<br>
		<br>
		<img src="audacityInterior.jpg" height="500" />
		<br>
		To capture interior engine sounds, I simply recorded from my computer's microphone after placing it in the passenger seat.<br>
		
		
		<br>
		For the exterior sound, I first recorded the engine sound from the side of the road, driving by at different RPM and engine loads.<br>
		Problem was, from the side of the road, a road car's engine note like mine is typically drowned out by tyre noise,<br>
		and I could not separate the engine note from the tyre noise in software. <br>
		<br>
		<img src="tonyBoot.jpg" height="500" />
		<br>
		To partially solve this problem, I convinced a friend of mine to sit in my boot to record the sounds close to the exhaust. It was surprisingly confortable according to him. <br>
		<br>
		The recording is mixed-in for the chase view, but it is not a great solution : recording close to the exhaust introduced noise from the exhaust gas airflow,
		but moving the microphone away introduced wind noises. <br>
		<br>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<br>
		
		I have shown you all of this in the hope you can feel my dedication and passion for cars, driving dynamics and vehicle physics.<br>
		Thank you for your time and I hope to interview for this internship.
